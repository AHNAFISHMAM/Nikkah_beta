    <h2>Understanding - From the Scholars</h2>

    <h3>The Pillars of a Valid Nikah</h3>
    <p>According to the scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah, a marriage contract must fulfill these conditions to be valid:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Guardian (Wali):</strong> The woman must have a male Muslim guardian (father, then grandfather, then brother, etc.) who gives her in marriage. The Prophet ﷺ said: "There is no marriage except with a guardian." This is the position of the majority of scholars including Imam Ahmad, Ash-Shafi''i, and Malik.</li>
      <li><strong>Two Witnesses:</strong> Two trustworthy Muslim male witnesses must be present at the time of the contract.</li>
      <li><strong>Mahr (Dowry):</strong> A gift from the husband to the wife, which is her right and becomes her property. It can be paid immediately or deferred.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Both parties must consent to the marriage. A woman cannot be forced into marriage against her will.</li>
      <li><strong>Offer and Acceptance (Ijab and Qabul):</strong> Clear words indicating marriage from both parties or their representatives.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Rights of the Husband</h3>
    <p>Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen and Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan explain that the husband''s rights include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Obedience in matters that are not sinful</li>
      <li>Not leaving the house without his permission</li>
      <li>Not admitting anyone into his house without his approval</li>
      <li>Guarding his wealth and honor</li>
      <li>Care of the household and children</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rights of the Wife</h3>
    <p>From the explanations of the scholars:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mahr:</strong> Her mandatory wedding gift that belongs solely to her</li>
      <li><strong>Nafaqah (Maintenance):</strong> Food, clothing, and housing according to the husband''s ability and the customs of the land</li>
      <li><strong>Kind Treatment:</strong> As Allah commanded: "And live with them honourably"</li>
      <li><strong>Justice:</strong> Fair treatment, especially in cases of polygyny</li>
      <li><strong>Physical and Emotional Companionship:</strong> The husband must not neglect her needs</li>
      <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Her own living space where she is not obligated to live with in-laws</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A Woman Cannot Be Forced Into Marriage</h3>
    <p>Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullah) stated that if a woman is married without her consent, the marriage is invalid. The Prophet ﷺ returned a woman to her family when she complained that her father married her without her consent. This shows the importance Islam places on the woman''s agreement to the marriage.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="application">
    <h2>Applying This</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>For Men:</strong> Understand your obligation to provide maintenance (nafaqah), treat your wife with kindness, and follow the example of the Prophet ﷺ in being the best to your family</li>
      <li><strong>For Women:</strong> Know your rights in Islam - including your right to mahr, maintenance, kind treatment, and not being forced into marriage</li>
      <li><strong>For Both:</strong> Ensure your nikah contract includes all the Islamic requirements: guardian, witnesses, mahr, and mutual consent</li>
      <li><strong>For Guardians:</strong> Do not force your daughter or ward into marriage, but also do not prevent her from a suitable match</li>
      <li>Keep the mahr reasonable - the Prophet ﷺ said the best mahr is that which is easy to give</li>
      <li>Build your marriage on the foundation of Islam - pray together, remind each other of Allah, and help each other in worship</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Understanding - From the Scholars</h2>

    <h3>The Prophetic Way of Communication</h3>
    <p>The scholars explain that the Prophet ﷺ was the best example in how he communicated with his wives. He would listen attentively, speak gently, use humor appropriately, never raise his voice in anger, and give his full attention when spoken to. Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) reported that he would listen to her complete her speech before responding.</p>

    <h3>Managing Anger - A Prophetic Approach</h3>
    <p>Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen explained that anger is from Shaytan and is the root of many marital problems. The Prophet ﷺ gave us practical solutions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Remain silent when angry</li>
      <li>Make wudu (ablution)</li>
      <li>If standing, sit down; if sitting, lie down</li>
      <li>Seek refuge in Allah from Shaytan</li>
      <li>Leave the room if necessary to cool down</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Privacy of Marital Affairs</h3>
    <p>The scholars of the Sunnah emphasize that what happens between husband and wife should remain private. The Prophet ﷺ forbade men and women from discussing intimate details of their married life with others. This extends to arguments and disagreements - do not involve unnecessary parties in your disputes.</p>

    <h3>When to Seek Help</h3>
    <p>Allah mentions in Surah An-Nisa (4:35) the system of arbitration when conflicts cannot be resolved between the spouses. Shaykh Al-Fawzan explains that this should be sought from trustworthy, knowledgeable people - ideally one from each family - who can help mediate and find solutions. This is before considering separation.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="application">
    <h2>Applying This</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Speak with kindness:</strong> Even in disagreement, use good words. The Prophet ﷺ said that a good word is charity.</li>
      <li><strong>Control your anger:</strong> When you feel anger rising, remain silent, make wudu, change your position, and seek refuge from Shaytan.</li>
      <li><strong>Listen before responding:</strong> Give your spouse your full attention. Don''t interrupt or dismiss their feelings.</li>
      <li><strong>Resolve quickly:</strong> Do not let the sun set on your anger. The Prophet ﷺ forbade Muslims to forsake each other beyond three days.</li>
      <li><strong>Apologize sincerely:</strong> The best of those who err are those who repent. Say "I''m sorry" and mean it.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid harmful speech:</strong> Never use insulting language, bring up past forgiven mistakes, or threaten divorce in anger.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep matters private:</strong> Don''t broadcast your arguments on social media or to uninvolved parties.</li>
      <li><strong>Seek help when needed:</strong> If issues persist, involve wise, trustworthy family members or Islamic counselors as arbitrators.</li>

    <h2>Understanding - From the Scholars</h2>

    <h3>Intimacy as Worship</h3>
    <p>The scholars explain that marital intimacy, when approached with the proper intention, becomes an act of worship. By keeping oneself and one''s spouse chaste and away from haram, one earns reward from Allah. The hadith in Sahih Muslim clearly establishes this principle.</p>

    <h3>What is Permitted and Prohibited</h3>
    <p>Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen, Shaykh Al-Albani, and other scholars clarify:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Permitted:</strong> All forms of intimacy between husband and wife in the natural place (vaginal intercourse) in any position</li>
      <li><strong>Prohibited:</strong>
        <ul>

    <h3>Family Planning Rulings</h3>
    <p>The scholars have ruled on various aspects of family planning:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Azl (Withdrawal):</strong> Permissible with the wife''s consent, as the Companions practiced it during the Prophet''s time (Bukhari, Muslim)</li>
      <li><strong>Temporary Contraception:</strong> Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen, Shaykh Ibn Baz, and the Permanent Committee ruled it permissible with conditions: mutual consent, no harm to health, and a valid reason (spacing children, health of mother, etc.)</li>
      <li><strong>Permanent Sterilization:</strong> Generally prohibited (haram) unless there is a genuine medical necessity that poses risk to the woman''s life. This is because it permanently prevents having children, which goes against the general Islamic encouragement to have offspring.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Privacy is Sacred</h3>
    <p>The Prophet ﷺ severely warned against discussing intimate marital details with others. Shaykh Al-Albani classified the hadith about this as authentic. What happens between husband and wife stays private.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="application">
    <h2>Applying This</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Begin intimacy with the dua taught by the Prophet ﷺ: <em>"Bismillah, Allahumma jannibna ash-shaytana wa jannib ash-shaytana ma razaqtana"</em></li>
      <li>Approach intimacy with patience and consideration - the Prophet ﷺ mentioned "kisses and speech" as preliminaries</li>
      <li>Ensure mutual satisfaction - do not be selfish in this matter</li>
      <li>Maintain hygiene and perform ghusl when required</li>
      <li>Keep all intimate matters private - never discuss details with anyone</li>
      <li>Family planning decisions should be made together with mutual consent</li>
      <li>Temporary contraception is permissible with agreement and valid reason</li>
      <li>Avoid permanent sterilization unless medically necessary</li>

    <h2>Understanding - From the Scholars</h2>

    <h3>The Husband''s Financial Obligation</h3>
    <p>Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen, Shaykh Ibn Baz, and the scholars explain that the husband is obligated to provide:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nafaqah (Maintenance):</strong> Food, drink, and all necessities</li>
      <li><strong>Clothing:</strong> According to what is customary and appropriate</li>
      <li><strong>Housing:</strong> Suitable accommodation according to his means</li>
      <li><strong>Medical Care:</strong> Treatment when she is ill</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The level of provision should be according to his means and what is customary in their society, as indicated by Surah At-Talaq 65:7.</p>

    <h3>The Wife''s Financial Independence</h3>
    <p>The scholars are unanimous that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The wife''s wealth is entirely her own</li>
      <li>She has no obligation to spend on the household</li>
      <li>Her mahr is her property - she can use it as she wishes</li>
      <li>Her inheritance belongs to her</li>
      <li>If she works and earns, that income is hers</li>
      <li>She may voluntarily contribute to the household expenses, but it is considered charity</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Mahr (Bridal Gift)</h3>
    <p>Shaykh Al-Fawzan explains:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The mahr is obligatory and the wife''s right</li>
      <li>It should be named in the marriage contract</li>
      <li>It can be paid immediately or deferred (or part of each)</li>
      <li>The Sunnah is to keep it moderate - the Prophet ﷺ said "the best mahr is that which is easy"</li>
      <li>Excessive mahr goes against the Sunnah and can cause hardship</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Avoiding Riba (Interest)</h3>
    <p>The scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah are unanimous that riba is one of the major sins. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Interest-based loans</li>
      <li>Credit card interest</li>
      <li>Conventional mortgages</li>
      <li>Interest-bearing savings accounts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Couples should seek halal alternatives such as Islamic financing, interest-free loans, and sharia-compliant banking.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="application">
    <h2>Applying This</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Before Marriage:</strong> Discuss financial expectations, debts, and goals transparently</li>
      <li><strong>Mahr:</strong> Agree on a reasonable amount following the Sunnah of keeping it moderate</li>
      <li><strong>Husband:</strong> Fulfill your obligation of nafaqah willingly - spending on family earns reward</li>
      <li><strong>Wife:</strong> Know your rights while being cooperative and not demanding beyond reasonable needs</li>
      <li><strong>Joint Planning:</strong> Make major financial decisions together through consultation (shura)</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Riba:</strong> Keep your income and transactions free from interest</li>
      <li><strong>Zakat:</strong> Calculate and pay zakat on your wealth annually</li>
      <li><strong>Charity:</strong> Give sadaqah regularly - it brings barakah to wealth</li>
      <li><strong>Budget:</strong> Create a household budget accounting for necessities, savings, and charity</li>
      <li><strong>Emergency Fund:</strong> Save for unexpected needs</li>

    <h2>Understanding - From the Scholars</h2>

    <h3>Rights of Parents</h3>
    <p>The scholars explain that honoring parents is one of the greatest obligations after worshipping Allah. This continues after marriage and includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Speaking to them respectfully</li>
      <li>Caring for them in old age</li>
      <li>Providing for them if they are in need</li>
      <li>Making dua for them</li>
      <li>Visiting them regularly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, obedience to parents does not extend to sinful matters or to oppressing one''s spouse.</p>

    <h3>The Wife''s Right to Separate Accommodation</h3>
    <p>Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen, Shaykh Ibn Baz, and the scholars of the Permanent Committee have ruled that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The wife has the right to her own accommodation</li>
      <li>She cannot be forced to live with her in-laws</li>
      <li>This is based on the verse "Lodge them where you dwell" (65:6)</li>
      <li>Even a separate room with her own facilities fulfills the minimum requirement</li>
      <li>If she agrees to live with in-laws, it should be by her genuine choice and she should be treated well</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Wife is NOT Obligated to Serve In-Laws</h3>
    <p>The scholars clarify that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The wife is not obligated to obey her in-laws</li>
      <li>Her obedience is to her husband in matters that are not sinful</li>
      <li>She is not required to cook, clean, or serve her in-laws</li>
      <li>If she does so, it is from her kindness and good character, not obligation</li>
      <li>The husband should not force her to serve his parents</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Understanding "The In-Law is Death"</h3>
    <p>Shaykh Al-Fawzan and other scholars explain this hadith means that the danger from male in-laws (like brother-in-law) entering upon a woman is severe because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>People are less cautious around relatives</li>
      <li>They may enter without hesitation</li>
      <li>This can lead to fitnah (temptation)</li>
      <li>The wife must observe hijab with male in-laws except her father-in-law</li>
      <li>She should not be alone with them (khalwah)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Balancing Parents and Spouse</h3>
    <p>Both have rights that must be fulfilled. The scholars advise:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Neither should be neglected for the other</li>
      <li>The husband should protect his wife from unfair treatment by his family</li>
      <li>The wife should respect her husband''s love for his parents</li>
      <li>Each spouse should handle issues with their own family</li>
      <li>When in conflict, prioritize what is obligatory over what is voluntary</li>

      <li><strong>Avoid khalwah:</strong> Do not be alone with in-laws of the opposite gender</li>
